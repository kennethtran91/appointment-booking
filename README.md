# Book Me!

The BookMe! Nail Appointment Booking App is a web-based application developed using the MEAN stack, designed to streamline the process of scheduling an appointments with ease. It provides a simple and efficient way for clients to book appointments with you for any services, while also automating reminders for both you and your clients.

# The Story

Have you ever encountered the frustration of constantly forgetting who booked appointments with your loved one? Well, I did, and that's how BookMe! came into existence.

My wife is a talented nail artist, and her schedule used to be a mess. She would spend hours every week trying to remember who had booked appointments, when they were scheduled, and trying to ensure that her clients didn't forget. Her little notebook, which she used to jot down appointments, was filled with crossed-out names and scribbles.

One day, as I watched her struggle with her scheduling chaos, it dawned on me that there had to be a better way. I decided to take matters into my own hands and develop a solution to simplify her booking process.
